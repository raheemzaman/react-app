        <h5>“Everything Starts as a Square” is a book and video course that teaches you a simple method to designing icons that anyone can learn.</h5>
         <p>Before I learned how to design icons myself, I always imagined that they were drawn by hand using the pen tool, some sort of fancy graphics tablet, and hours and hours spent manually fine-tuning bezier curves.</p>
         <p>But it turns out this isn’t how great icon designers work at all.</p>
         <p>“Everything Starts as a Square”, you’ll learn the systems experts use to create pixel perfect icons, without relying on a steady hand.</p>
